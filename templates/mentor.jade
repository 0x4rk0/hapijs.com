		h2 Introduction

		p The goal of the hapi.js mentor program is to help individuals get comfortable and effective using hapi.js, make the hapi.js more accessible to a diverse community of developers, and empower developers to participate and contribute back to the hapi.js community.

		p Please use the forms below to apply as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R1_WslDk_2WIYAu29y_TOpy_J6ofPhCe4jPLl4md3u8/viewform">Mentor</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R4VS7IcWJrm_0puv-38QzlEpe33i1yRltuv3ihI10PI/viewform">Mentee</a>, and of course, you are always welcome to begin [Contributing]() to hapi.js.

		p If you need immediate or casual help, feel free to tweet out to a(href="http://www.twitter.com/hapijs")@hapijs or use IRC: #hapi on a(href="https://freenode.net/") freenode. The goal of the mentors program is to set up longer term one-on-one relationships for a more directed, personal support.

		p Duration of the mentorship program can be between 6 to 12 months, with a participant being able to leave the program at any time. This is a purely volunteer program where those who have benefits from hapi.js are giving back and helping others to master the tools (in hope that they will then pass it on as future mentors and module maintainers themselves).

				h4 What's Expected for Mentors

				p Knowledge of the <a href="https://www.github.com/hapijs">hapi.js</a> environment is a great start. Mentees can ask questions about anything within the ecosystem, and there's a lot there. Ultimately, a mentor doesn't need to know everything, but at least have a good idea of where to look. The rest of the mentors group is here to help, so feel free to reach out and sign up. 

				p Time commitments should be limited to around an hour a week unless you would like to devote more time. Thanks very much for interest!

		h2 Local Mentors

		p If you're interested in getting advice from a local mentor, there may be some in your city. Look for Node meetups in your area, and see if any of the mentor team will be there. If you're looking for longer term help with learning, check out the normal Mentoring Program.

		h2 <a name="Code of Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>

		p hapi.js aims to be a community in which anyone can participate regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).Â­

		p Until the official hapi.js Code of Conduct is being used, please utilize the <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Conference Code of Conduct</a>. tl;dr: Don't be a jerk.
