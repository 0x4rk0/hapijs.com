      p During the last week weâ€™ve closed <strong>#{issues.length} #{issueString}</strong>, merged <strong>#{pullRequests.length} #{pullRequestString}</strong> and pushed <strong>#{commits.length} #{commitString}</strong> to master branch.

      p If you want information about modules releases in the ecosystem other than the core hapi module, you can look into issues in their respective repositories. They are labelled with <strong>release notes</strong> or <strong>breaking changes</strong> for major releases, otherwise for the minor releases check the issues <strong>milestones</strong>.
